## Abstract
Acute exacerbations in the form of cytokine storm are the main cause of organ failure caused by SARS-related coronaviruses and mediated by pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs in immune cells. While the effectors of these transcriptional changes have been sufficiently studied, there is a noticeable lack of interventional treatments for acute exacerbations. An important interface of innate immune signalling are the components of the JAK/STAT pathway, activated by interferons as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6. An intervention based on the IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, has already been proposed and is currently in clinical trial; however, the antibody does not differentiate between soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors und thus may inhibit regenerative processes. Here, I propose utilising recombinant soluble protein gp130, also known as IL6ST, as a bioidentical scavenger molecule for activated soluble IL6R, while retaining the desirable functionality of membrane-bound IL6R. In light of SARS patient expression profiles, and of IL6R and gp130 tissue distribution, the clinical testing of soluble gp130 is a warranted alternative to monoclonal antibody therapy.
